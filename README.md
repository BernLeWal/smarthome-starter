## Overview

└───arduino                         // Hardware devices with firmware
    ├───humitemp-sensor             // HumiTemp-Sensor to measure temperature and humidity
    └───test-esp32_blinking_led     // Testapplication to verify correct IDE-setup with ESP32
```

## Getting started

1. Buy your first ESP32 and get to know your Arduino developing environment in [arduino/test-esp32_blinking_led/](./arduino/test-esp32_blinking_led/README.md)

2. Build your first Sensor - a HumiTemp sensor to measure temperature and humidity - using the guide in [arduino/humitemp-sensor/](./arduino/humitemp-sensor/README.md). THis guide shows also how to configure your MQTT-Client or MQTT-Dashboard Android App to watch your readings.
